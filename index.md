## Welcome to Intermedio

Intermedio is planned to be an HTML5 canvas based Jacascript API for statistical graphics.

The project is in its very early stages.  The primary goal is to
develop a Canvas-based Javascript API for static and interactive
graphics that is similar to (and developed in parallel with) a similar
R graphics API (tessella).
